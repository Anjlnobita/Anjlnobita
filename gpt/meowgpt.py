'''
To further advance your Telegram bot by adding more features, enhancing owner commands, and improving error handling, we can implement several additional functionalities. Below is a comprehensive approach to improve the bot:

### New Features to Implement

1. **Advanced Owner Commands**: 
   - Implement commands to view active users, restart the bot, toggle specific features, and retrieve logs.
   
2. **Persistent User Preferences**: 
   - Store user preferences (like preferred language or commands) to tailor responses based on the user's prior interactions.

3. **Admin Notifications**: 
   - Notify the owner when the bot encounters significant errors or specific events (threshold for user requests).

4. **User Feedback Collection**: 
   - Implement a system to collect and store user feedback about the bot's responses, making it easier to improve the bot.

5. **Extended Interactive Commands**: 
   - Add commands for retrieving facts (e.g., fun facts, tech facts) and handling small quizzes.

6. **Improved Error Handling**: 
   - Utilize better exception handling strategies to catch and log errors without crashing the bot, and provide user-friendly messages.

### Updated Bot Code

Here’s the complete bot code with the added features and improvements:

```

### Key Features Explained

1. **Owner ID Management**:
   - The owner ID is stored in `config.py`, allowing it to be easily managed and maintained.

2. **Owner Specific Commands**: 
   - The bot has commands like `/toggle_chatgpt` for enabling/disabling the ChatGPT functionality and `/restart` for restarting the bot, validating access by checking the user ID.

3. **Dynamic Language Support**:
   - Supports several languages, ensuring users can communicate effectively in their preferred language.

4. **User and Group Interaction**:
   - The bot differentiates between private messages and group chats, allowing it to engage meaningfully in both contexts.

5. **Casual Conversational Style**:
   - The bot maintains a friendly, warm tone in its responses, making the interaction enjoyable.

6. **Extensive Error Handling**:
   - Implements error logging for different functionalities, ensuring that issues are captured and can be easily reviewed.

### Running the Bot

To run the bot:
1. Make sure you have all the necessary Python libraries installed (`pyrogram`, `pymongo`, `openai`, `langdetect`).
2. Ensure that the configuration in `config.py` is properly set.
3. Start the bot using:
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```
